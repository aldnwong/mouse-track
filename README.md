# Mouse-Track Experiment
This experiment originally served as a testing ground of an effect I wanted to implement into a website.
This person tracks the position of the mouse relative to the location of the person's eyes.
The person will open their eyes wider if the mouse gets close to them, and has an animation to hide when toggled.
This is a barebones version of the idea and I eventually ended up not using it.
